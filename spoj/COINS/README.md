Solution is pretty straightforward – use recursive descent to find global optimal solution. To win some calculation time, we will precalculate first 0 <= N <= 9000 steps. 

Source code limit is 50KB, so you can’t fit more precalculated steps without compression or tricks, however even 9000 precalculated steps is enough to solve the problem.
