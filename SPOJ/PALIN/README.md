The idea is to add 1 to lower digits position of big input number, until they start to form palindrome from boundaries to center of number. There are also checks for special cases when we have numbers like 9998, 9999 or palindrome as input.

Solution can be optimized even more (e.g. reversenum could be removed if you do some tiny modifications of traversals in addOne and solve functions, so you would have less memory consumption).
